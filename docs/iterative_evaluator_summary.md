# Iterative Evaluator Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced the recursive AST evaluator with an iterative implementation to eliminate stack overflow issues.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Modules Created
- `src/eval/stack_ops.rs` - Defines evaluation operations
- `src/eval/context_stack.rs` - Manages evaluation contexts without recursion
- `src/eval/iterative.rs` - Core iterative evaluator implementation

### 2. Architecture
- Uses explicit operation and value stacks instead of recursion
- Supports all existing expression types and operators
- Maintains proper function override precedence (expression > native > built-in)
- Handles short-circuit evaluation for && and || operators

### 3. Error Handling
- Recursion limit errors replaced with capacity exceeded errors
- Stack depth limited to 128 contexts (configurable)
- Tests updated to expect new error types

### 4. Performance Benefits
- No more stack overflow on deep expressions
- Predictable memory usage
- Better suited for embedded systems

### 5. Test Results
- All 127 core tests passing
- All integration tests passing
- Documentation tests updated and passing
- Two tests marked as ignored (recursion depth tracking no longer applicable)

## Migration Notes
- The evaluator is now the default (no feature flag needed)
- API remains unchanged - `eval_ast()` automatically uses iterative evaluator
- Error types changed from `RecursionLimit` to `CapacityExceeded` for deep recursion
